In this step, we will layout a static version.\n\nFirst, we can make some simple changes to rebrand the app as `Playlist 1` instead of `Template 1`\n\nFirst replace the existing corresponding lines of code with each of the following in the views:\n\n## views/partials/menu.hbs\n\n~~~html\n...\n  <header class=\"ui header item\"> Playlist 1 </header>\n...\n~~~\n\n## views/about.hbs\n\n~~~html\n...\n  <h3>\n    Playlist 1\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n    A Little Playlist Maker - Version 1\n  </p>\n...\n~~~\n\nNow the controllers:\n\n## controllers/about.js\n\n~~~javascript\n...\n    const viewData = {\n      title: 'About Playlist 1',\n    };\n...\n~~~\n\n## controllers/dashboard.js\n\n~~~javascript\n...\n    const viewData = {\n      title: 'Playlist 1 Dashboard',\n    };\n...\n~~~\n\nMake sure the app is still running, but with the new branding. If there are errors, turn the logs and you may be able to see the source of the problem - which will usually be some small error in the javascript sources.\n"

    {
    "title": "# Static Playlist",
    "shortTitle": "03",
    "contentMd" : "# Static Playlist\n\nIn this step we will start to display the playlist itself. First, create a new partial called `listsongs.hbs`:\n\n## views/partials/listsongs.hbs\n\n~~~html\n<table class=\"ui table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Song</th>\n      <th>Artist</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n      </td>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n~~~\n\nMake sure you include the folder name in the full file name when creating this file.\n\n![](img/11.png)\n\nChange the dashboard view to invoke this partial:\n\n## views/dashboard.hbs\n\n~~~html\n{{> menu id=\"dashboard\"}}\n\n<section class=\"ui segment\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    Playlist Title\n  </h2>\n  {{> listsongs}}\n</section>\n~~~\n\nMake sure the app runs successfully.\n\nTo test out the UX, we might include some actual songs (replace the tbody with the following):\n\n## views/partials/listsongs.hbs\n\n~~~html\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 3\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 7\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 10\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n~~~\n\n... and also give the playlist a title:\n\n## views/dashboard.hbs\n\n~~~html\n....\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    Beethoven Sonatas\n  </h2>\n...\n~~~\n\nExercise the UX fully again. Keep an eye on the logs\n\n![](img/06.png)\n\nLocate where in the controllers these messages are being generated:\n\n~~~js\n...\n    logger.info('start rendering');\n...\n~~~\n\nThese logging messages are a useful technique for figuring out what might be going wrong with an app. There are three variants of the logging statement: `info`, `error` and `debug`. Experiment now with some of these, and exercise the app to make sure the log messages appear.\n\n~~~js\n...\n    logger.error('some error has occurred');\n...\n~~~\n\n~~~js\n...\n    logger.debug('some step has occurred...');\n...\n~~~\n\nError and debug messages may appear in red.

    "contentMd" : "# Dynamic Playlist\n\nThe app as we have it now could have been completely built as a static web site. However, the framework and tools we have used in this version enable us to evolve this static site into an interactive web app.\n\nThe first step is to eliminate some of the static content from the listsongs partial. Here is a new version to replace the current version (in listsongs.hbs replace the table with the following):\n\n~~~html\n<table class=\"ui table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Song</th>\n      <th>Artist</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    {{#each playlist.songs}}\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          {{title}}\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          {{artist}}\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    {{/each}}\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n~~~\n\nIn the above, we are `iterating` over an `array` of `songs` inside a `playlist` object:\n\n~~~html\n{{#each playlist.songs}}\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      {{title}}\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      {{artist}}\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n{{/each}}\n~~~\n\nThis playlist object must be passed to the view for this to work.\n\nIn the `dashboard.js` controller, we can define a playlist object in Javascript (place this definition prior to the dashboard object definition):\n\n~~~js\nconst sonatas = {\n  title: 'Sonatas',\n  songs: [\n    {\n      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 3',\n      artist: 'Beethoven',\n    },\n    {\n      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 7',\n      artist: 'Beethoven',\n    },\n    {\n      title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10',\n      artist: 'Beethoven',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n~~~\n\nExamine the above structure carefully. This is a javascript `object literal`. It consists of :\n\n- a title field containing the string `Sonatas`\n- an array called `songs`, which contains 3 objects, each of which has:\n    - title\n    - artist\n\nThe index method which is located in  dashboard.js file can now be modified to pass this list to the view:\n\n~~~js\nconst dashboard = {\nindex(request, response) {\n  logger.info('dashboard rendering');\n  const viewData = {\n    title: 'Playlist Dashboard',\n    playlist: sonatas,\n  };\n  response.render('dashboard', viewData);\n},\n};\n~~~\n\nThis should work now as expected. Make sure the playlist is displayed as expected.\n\nWe can take advantage of the logger to display the playlist before we render it:\n\n~~~js\nindex(request, response) {\n  logger.info('dashboard rendering');\n  const viewData = {\n    title: 'Playlist Dashboard',\n    playlist: sonatas,\n  };\n  logger.info('about to render', sonatas);\n  response.render('dashboard', viewData);\n},\n~~~\n\nYou should see something like this in the logs:\n\n![](img/07.png)\n\n## Logs\n\nWe can change the format of the logs to better reflect the underlying data structure. Locate this line in `utils/logger.js`:\n\n~~~\n  transports: [new (winston.transports.Console)({ json: false })],\n~~~\n\nWe dont need to understand the details - but we can change `false` to `true`:\n\n~~~\n  transports: [new (winston.transports.Console)({ json: true })],\n~~~\n\nThis will change how the playlists are displayed in the logs:\n\n![](img/13.png)\n\n\n\n"

Introduce an ID for every playlist, and every song, now.\n\nFor instance for a playlist:\n\n~~~js\n\"playlistCollection\": [\n   {\n     \"id\": \"01\",\n     \"title\": \"Beethoven Sonatas\",\n     \"songs\": [\n~~~\n\n... and for a song:\n\n~~~\n{\n  \"id\": \"03\",\n  \"title\": \"Piano Sonata No. 3\",\n  \"artist\": \"Beethoven\"\n},\n~~~\n\nPlace unique IDs on all your playlists and songs now. You can use any unique numbers (enclosed in double quotes) for the moment.\n\n## Exercise 4: New Fields\n\nExtend the playlist to have new entry called `duration`. Also, extend each song to also have a `duration` field + a `genre` field.\n\nModify the dashboard view to display these new fields.\n\n## Exercise 4: \n\nExtend the following views:\n\n- Welcome: Extend the welcome view to contain a more detailed outline of the purpose of the application\n- About: Extend the about view to provide contact details (may be fictitious) for the author/company that created the app.\n\n## Exercise 5: Run Locally\n\nDownload the app and run it on your own workstation.
